Node SAML is intented to be an implementation of the entire SAML 2.0
specification. The specification includes Identity Provider requirements
as well as Service Provider Details. There is a stretch goal creating an
angular service that submits assertions based on the specification
details.

There is a secondary intention of utilizing native javascript promise
queues for assertion creation and resolution.

Any and all help is welcome. All communication will happen through
github.
